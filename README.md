## LoLDecay

### Live Site
http://www.loldecay.com (Under construction)

### Description
LoLDecay is a ranked decay tracker for League of Legends accounts. This web application allows them to know how many days they have left before they decay. An optional feature lets users sign up for automatic email notifications.

### Purpose
This was originally created and compiled by Roland Zeng (rzeng95). My front-end contributions are purely recreational.

### Feedback
I'm always open to improvement, so feel free to shoot me an e-mail at bianca@echoviral.com or join the Discord server: (https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-lolcarry-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/mKTTFdd)
