# LoLDecay

## Description
LoLDecay is a ranked decay tracker for League of Legends accounts. Inactive players slowly lose LP (decay) and this web application allows them to know how many days they have left before they decay. An optional feature lets users sign up for automatic email notifications.

This was originally created by Roland Zeng (rzeng95). I'm currently working on front-end renovations for recreational causes.
